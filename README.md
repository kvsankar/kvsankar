### Projects on Github

I developed some spacecraft orbit animations for Chandrayaan-2 (ISRO), Mars Orbiter Mission (ISRO), and New Horizons (NASA) for educational purposes. 
These animations use real orbit ephemerides data from JPL NASA shared via the Horizons platform. 
I have been influential in making this data public for the first time in 2013 during the Mars Orbiter Mission. 
I am thankful to Jon D. Giorgini at JPL who has been very supportive in answering my queries. 
While all animations support 2D animations, the Chandrayaan-2 animation also supports 3D. 
All animations have controls to visualize the orbits as heliocentric, geocentric, selenocentric, or Mars centric as the case may be. 
You can pan and zoom as well or keep an object of interest centered while the world moves around it. 
Mission timelines are shown with annotated events such as orbit boost burns and orbit insertions. 
Source code for these animations are available on this Github site under the MIT license. 
These animations were well received over social media for their educational content. 

#### Chandrayaan 2

Chandrayaan-2 (ISRO, Wikipedia) is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation, after Chandrayaan-1. 
It consists of a lunar orbiter, and also included the Vikram lander, and the Pragyan lunar rover, all of which were developed in India. 
It was launched on 22 July 2019. Lunar orbit insertion was done on 22 August 2019. 
The Vikram lander was lost on 6 September 2019 very close to lunar landing.
